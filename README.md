##  Project Overview  
This web application is a fun, interactive Cat Facts generator. It fetches random cat facts from an external API and displays them dynamically to the user without refreshing the page. The site is responsive and provides a clean, mobile-friendly experience.

##  Technologies Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Fetch API  
- Git & GitHub  

##  Features  
- Single-page dynamic interface (no page refreshes)  
- Responsive layout  
- Clean UI with modern JavaScript practices (e.g., `let`/`const`, event listeners)

## Development Process  
1. **Mockup & Planning**: Sketched a simple layout and identified user interactions.  
2. **Static Prototype**: Built out HTML/CSS and ensured responsiveness.  
3. **Dynamic Functionality**: Integrated JavaScript to fetch and render API data.  
4. **Testing**: Performed mobile testing and ensured cross-browser functionality.

##  Challenges Faced  
- Handling API errors and ensuring fallback behavior.  
- Making sure all DOM events were handled with `addEventListener`.  
- Ensuring a smooth user experience without reloads.

##  Resources Used  
- MDN Web Docs  
- Stack Overflow  
- W3Schools (for CSS layout tuning)
